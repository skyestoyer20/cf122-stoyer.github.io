<p>	Union Square is a very popular spot, with its few subway stations, there are people bustling about as well as sitting, maybe talking amongst friends, or eating. There are many benches lining the pathways that connect 16th and 14th street, as well as neon yellow chairs, out early in the day to dawn.
