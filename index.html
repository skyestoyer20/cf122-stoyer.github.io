	The shoebill (Balaeniceps rex) also known as whalehead, whale-headed stork, whalebill,[3] or shoebill stork, is a very large stork-like bird. It derives its name from its enormous shoe-shaped bill. It has a somewhat stork-like overall form and has previously been classified with the storks in the order Ciconiiformes based on this morphology. However, genetic evidence places it with pelicans and herons in the Pelecaniformes. The adult is mainly grey while the juveniles are more brown. It lives in tropical east Africa in large swamps from South Sudan to Zambia.[4]
